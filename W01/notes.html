    <h1>Week 1 - Notes</h1>
    <p>If you design for the smallest, least powerful device forst, then yu will focus on the content,
        and your core fuctionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way
        around, it'll be like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank, which is neither asimple, 
        nor beautiful. (Joel Marsh - The Hipper Element)
